<strong>In today's</strong> increasingly fast-paced society, people need to be efficient in getting through their pre-existing obligations, yet also simultaneously be informed of current events. 
<br />
<br />
Conventional news-media outlets provide the necessary information, but in a way that requires already limited time and energy. A possible solution to this 21st-dilemma would be an online source of the day's most integral and vital happenings, summarized in a way that highlights the essentials. 
<br />
<br />
It is because of this reason we have created Brief.- a resource containing straightforward descriptions of international events with widespread repercussions.
<br />
<br />
Our purpose with this site is therefore to provide news in a format that is compatible to our fast-paced life, but also hopefully spread awareness of global affairs.
